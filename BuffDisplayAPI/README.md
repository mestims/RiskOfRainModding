# BuffDisplayAPI
	- BuffDisplayAPI allows modders to set custom buffs to the buffdisplay easily
		- This requires adding a component which does the logic for the buff to the character
		- Allows custom text and alpha level
	- Why like this
		- I made this as an extension to [BanditPlus]{https://thunderstore.io/package/mistername/Banditplus/}
		- For feature request, you can always message me on discord and it's open source 
	- How-to
		- Create your own component which contains all the logic for the buff and it should contain a public string Text and public float Alpha
		- For an example see [BanditPlus]{https://thunderstore.io/package/mistername/Banditplus/}
